first steps in programming
Hello. 
My name is Oleg, i'm from Russia. 
I have a high education in civil engineering and now i try to learn programming.
Now i read the book "Structure and interpretation of computer programs" and try to do excersices from this.
I think that there is some lack of concentration in me, but i'll try to fight with it.
